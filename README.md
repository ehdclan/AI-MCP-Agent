# LangChain Banking Assistant

## Overview

This is a **conversational banking assistant** built using **LangChain** and **Azure OpenAI**, designed to handle user queries related to banking services such as checking account balances, handling transactions, and managing account-related inquiries.

It uses a **Zero-Shot Agent** architecture, memory buffers to maintain context across a session, and multiple tools to classify intent and perform banking actions.

---

## Features

* **User Login & Session Management**:  
  Secure PIN-based authentication system with session persistence. Once logged in, users do not need to repeatedly provide account information.

* **Intent Classification**:  
  All user queries are first classified using `IntentClassifier` to determine if they relate to balances, transactions, card issues, or unsupported actions.

* **Context-Aware Memory**:  
  Conversation history is stored in a memory buffer. Previously provided information such as **3-digit account IDs** is reused automatically in the same session.

* **Banking Tools**:
  * `CheckBalance` – Fetch account balance for a given account ID.  
  * `HandleTransaction` – Handles transaction-related queries, including pending or failed transfers.  
  * `ReportCardIssues` – Handles **card-related issues only**, such as lost cards, damaged cards, activation issues, or cards not working.  
  * `Unsupported` – Determines if a query cannot be processed by other tools.

* **Safe Handling of Missing Data**:  
  Placeholder messages are used when required data (e.g., real transaction history) is unavailable, preventing loops or repeated clarification requests.

* **User-Friendly Prompting**:  
  The assistant follows step-by-step reasoning guidelines:
  * Only asking for clarification when absolutely necessary.  
  * Reusing account IDs from memory instead of asking repeatedly.  
  * Avoiding infinite loops in follow-up questions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd LangChain-Banking-Agent
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment and credentials (`.env`)

This project uses several Azure credentials and an inference endpoint for intent classification. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the values described below.

> **Important:** Never commit `.env` to source control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### Example `.env` (template)

```text
# Azure OpenAI / Cognitive Services resource credentials used by the LLM/speech code
azure_resource_key=<your_azure_cognitive_or_openai_key_here>
azure_resource_endpoint=https://<your-resource-name>.<region>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/

# Model API (used for intent classifier or custom classifier endpoint)
model_api_key=<your_model_api_key_here>
model_endpoint=https://<your-inference-host>/score

# Azure Speech (optional, if using speech integration)
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=<your_speech_key_here>
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=<speech_region>
```

### Where to get each value

* **`azure_resource_key` & `azure_resource_endpoint`**
  Create an **Azure OpenAI** or **Cognitive Services** resource in the Azure Portal.

  * Open the resource → **Keys and Endpoint** → copy any key + the endpoint URL.

* **`model_api_key` & `model_endpoint`**
  Used if the assistant calls an external hosted endpoint (Azure ML, custom inference service, etc.) for intent classification.

  * For development, you may use a simple local classifier and set these values accordingly.

* **`AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` & `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION`** (optional)
  Required only if enabling speech-to-text or text-to-speech.

If you're unsure which classifier endpoint to use, follow your organization’s instructions or use a mock classifier during development.

## Usage

Run the assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```

Log in with test credentials:

```
Welcome. Please login to continue.

Enter your Account ID: 001
Enter your PIN: 1234

✅ Login successful! Welcome back, Ini!
```

Ask questions in natural language:

```
You: What's my balance?
Assistant: Hello Ini! Your balance is ₦200,000.
```

Card issues:

```
You: I lost my card
Assistant:
Hello Ini!
Your card has been blocked immediately.

Next steps:
• New card ready in 48 hours  
• Collect at any branch with ID  
• Reference: CARD-001-LOST/STOLEN  
• Urgent help: 0800-BANK-HELP
```

Transactions:

```
You: Show my transactions
Assistant: [Displays transaction history]
```

Type `exit` to quit or `logout` to switch users.

## Key Components

* **main.py** – Handles user authentication, agent initialization, conversation loop.
* **utils.py** – Implements banking logic: balance checks, transactions, card issue reporting.
* **tools.py** – Defines LangChain tools used by the agent.

## Test Accounts

| Account ID | PIN  | Name   | Balance     |
| ---------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| 001        | 1234 | Ini    | ₦200,000    |
| 002        | 5678 | Bolu   | ₦420,000    |
| 003        | 9012 | Ebuka  | ₦30,000,000 |
| 004        | 3456 | Daniel | ₦250,000    |

## Notes

* **Memory Handling**:
  `ConversationBufferMemory` stores past queries and account IDs so the agent can reuse them in a session.

* **Loop Prevention**:
  For queries that cannot be processed (e.g., missing real-world transaction data), the assistant returns a polite placeholder and does **not** repeatedly ask for confirmation.

* **Security**:
  Keep the `.env` file private. Never commit credentials.

* **Authentication**:
  PIN-based login is for demo purposes only. Production systems should implement secure password hashing and MFA.

---

## Future Improvements

* Integrate real banking API data sources.
* Expand tool support (loans, transfers, bill payments).
* Add multi-user concurrency and persistent session storage.
* Implement secure credential storage and encryption.
* Create a web or mobile UI.
